      <p class="w3-text-grey">The first lecture was an introduction lecture to the Software Engineering course where we went over the basics of the semester, how it will work and what our assessments will be. At one point in the lesson we were tasked with doing some self-learning to which I researched a few things about the assessments and sorted out a few jobs, what was unknown to us is that Adon was watching over us to see how we would use our self-directed time and if it was wise or not. After that I came to the realisation that I did mess around a lot on my phone in between tasks and overall was not focused on my work. I know now to keep this in mind and make sure that I keep myself on task and up to date on my work as to not get side-tracked as this can happen quite easily on early days especially.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">This period we stated to work with Laragon which we had previously used in the first period of introductory app development, so I was familiar with the program. We were put into our groups and we were tasked with using GitHub to all work on the same project at the same time. We kept having issues mainly with pushing and pulling projects. The person who created the document would have all the necessary files to run the website on the local host, but anyone that pulled it from GitHub would not have those files and therefore could not run it. We ended up making some changes to the .readme files and installing some extra software that the host had to try and fix it but ultimately we got to a point where we could load up the project but were still getting errors when we tried to use the webpage on the local host. These issues should be ironed out by next class, if not there is another way, we can load it us with it all working but is more time consuming and tedious. </p>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">27/7</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Today we continued to work on our CRUD app where we got to iron out a lot of the issues that we were having in the previous lesson. One of our issues is that we had no idea about a CRUD app and how we would go about actually making one. Adon recommended actually looking it up and learning more about CRUD which through looking it up was a template for us to create a web page that can create, update and delete data which is what we need to do. Using google seems like something that should be done in any situation where you don’t know what you’re doing, I think our problem however is that we were looking up the wrong things including how to create a array in js and how to actually use JS in Laravel, but it was much easier and simple to just look up what a CRUD app was which gave us everything we needed to know. We were also able to fix out GitHub issues which we were worried about having, once we worked them out it was much easier than we initially thought. Fixing it gave me a deeper understanding of git and how to fix these issues when they arise.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Today we were looking into user cases which are used to figure out what a user would be looking for in an application. These simple statements can be used to break down a project into tiny bite sized pieces that can be used to hand out to group member to try an implement these features in our application when we get out assignment next week. We trialled these out on a pre-existing project where we had to make these statements as a group. The problem is that we all made our individual statements and did not do them as a group. This means that we will have to work on working as a group together if we want to do well as a group on out final project.</p>
