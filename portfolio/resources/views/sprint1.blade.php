      <p class="w3-text-grey">Today was the first day of our first spring where we started to modify our CRUD app to be our outline for our project. This class I fixed up all of the user stories to be used for our website so they can be handed out to people as thing needed to be done, and the others worked mainly on the app researching how to create a crud app and make it look presentable. By the end of the lesson we had a functioning create and view part of the crud app with appropriate layout and buttons that take us to other pages. I believe already we have made a good start in our project so that we can start dividing out work to be done by each person. Next class will be a git workshop lab so we can get a greater understanding on what we can do to minimise merging when we push our work.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">This was the second class of our first sprint where we had our interview with our client on what type of website we were making and what features we wanted in our website. This interview was short and to the point, we are to make a gaming website like the preview website from the previous year with some different features here and there. We mainly have free range on the website, but I feel like the client will make us change some of the stuff we have made so we will have to account for that later down the track. The rest of this lesson I wrote up the requirements to both one note and our GitHub project so someone can claim the task and work on it. We also had a GitHub workshop so we created our sperate branches with this information which should resolve merging issues. I stated on making a search bar with a drop-down menu to make going from page to page a lot easier, and so that we have a working webpage to show at the end of our first sprint.</p>

      <h1>Sprint Outlines:</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Professional Achievement:</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">For the first sprint I wanted everything to be laid out in a way that would make it easier for our group to coordinate our work and lay our workload out in a way that was easily accessible and quick to read and understand. I achieved this by merging all the user stories into one document, deleting the duplicate ones, and typing them up how each one should be laid out with “I want, so I” statements. I also typed up the interview from our client and put everything down in bullet pointed parts that the team can easily pick out. I also duplicated this as a git hub project so team members can pick and choose what they want to complete each sprint.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Technical Achievement:</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey"> I made a Navigation bar and hamburger model early on in a layout file with a content section so we would have a basic layout for each page so that our teammates could easily add on their pages with a present layout to change and access from the navigation bar. I did this early on to try and make our lives a bit easier by not having to type in a route in the web navigation every time we wanted to work on a different page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1>Agile Evidence:</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Values:</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">1. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: the interview was us and the client discussing items and functions that they would like in their website; these were all written out as items that we must complete.</p>
      
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Principles:</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">10. Simplicity: I wanted everything to be easily assessable for my team with user stories, git hub projects and a navigation bar to make everyone’s lives easier and simple.</p>
      
      <h1>Personal Reflection:</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">What did you do well?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">I believe that I was useful in the way that I wanted to make thing easier for our team and took the jobs where I could modify our requirements into a more attractive layout to make navigation of our requirements easier.</p>
    
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">What could you have done better?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">I could have focused on more software work as more of my time was spent on getting our user stories, interview and git hub sorted which left me not a lot of time to work on the back end of the website.</p>
    
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">What lessons did you learn?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">I learnt that there would be a lot of work ahead of us one I read through our clients requirements which means my time management on the tasks that I will take will need to be improved if I want to get everything done in time for our sprints.</p>
    
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">What barriers did you encounter?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">I think that getting started was the hardest part as there was so much that needed to be done that it was hard to decide what to take first and figure out what would be the most useful for our team. In the end I decided on getting the things that I knew how to do first and take it as I go.</p>
