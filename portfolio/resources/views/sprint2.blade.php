      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">24/8</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">This was the first day of the second sprint where we set out with a range of tasks that each member would contribute to, in the hopes that we will have a working website pushed to the master branch. This was a slow day as only two people showed and I showed up around 10 minutes late due to just having moved the day before, but even though I was late I still informed our team members using Microsoft teams, and so did our other teammates letting us know that they will not be there. I started to work on getting ever page accessible from the navigation bar so I can start to sort and organise the dropdown menus, hamburger model and authorised access to pages. This way I can fully start to figure out how to make our website laid out on both desktop and mobile.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">27/8</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">This was the last day of our sprint which was only a short one, what I got done was really trying to sort out the dropdown menu which I changed up by using JavaScript instead of CSS as much as I felt like CSS was what was holding me back and giving me a lot of issues trying to get everything working together. Besides that, I did a lot of remodelling and cleaning up of the pages and CSS files as a lot of stuff was just placed around the pages willy-nilly with no real order. When we pushed our stuff to GitHub however a lot of the stuff I did got lost and changed from what was on my branch and what was on the master branch. I don’t know if we may have pushed our stuff wrong or if GitHub didn’t really follow what we were trying to do but in the end I had to go back into my branch and try and save some of the changes as they really ruined the layout of our website. I got that sorted however and re-pushed it to master. We also started to deploy our website to MariaDB but it does not look that great now so that will have to be a goal for the next sprint.</p>

      <h1>Sprint Outlines:</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Professional Achievement:</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">This was the first time that we merged out work together which we all had to figure out together which took a lot of teamwork and communication to do a certain order of steps to get everything pushed and pulled in a way that we had an attractive and working master branch version of our website.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Technical Achievement:</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">This was more of the same as last sprint where I was still working on the hamburger model and dropdown menu inside of the nav bar, but this time it was upgrading it and finding a way to do it that was easy to modify and expand for all of our team to use. This time I was working more with CSS and starting to make everything look appealing for the design of our website. It was at this time that I was working with colour pallets and how each colour looked and complimented each other.</p>

    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1>Agile Evidence:</h1>
      
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Principles:</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Working software is the primary measure of progress: I wanted to get the navigation bar done and working before I moved on as I needed to get to a point where I can call it finished even If I want to modify it later on, which is where I got to.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">6. Enable face-to-face interactions: we wanted to do the merging of our work in person to make sure that we got everything right by doing it one by one, pulling each time on different devices to make sure noting got lost or broken during the process.</p>

      <h1>Personal Reflection:</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">What did you do well?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">I worked well with our teammates when we were pushing and pulling our work for the first time as I was asking a lot of questions and getting a lot of help but I was also answering a lot of questions and helping out others once I knew what I was doing. </p>
    
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">What could you have done better?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">I think I could have spent less time on stuff that I was working on last sprint as it should have been work that I had finished the previous sprint. I know I should have moved onto another part of the website to continuously keep new features and designs rolling in.</p>
    
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">What lessons did you learn?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">I learnt that it was ok to be asking a lot of questions in our group as it is really the quickest way to learn a new skill and to be able to pass on that information if needed to someone else. And visa versa it is ok to answer a lot of questions so that our teammates can do the same and keep up with each other and not let anyone slip behind. </p>
    
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">What barriers did you encounter?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The navigation bar continued to be a problem to work on as not a lot of what I was doing was working the way I expected. Some of this was due to the fact that we were using a lot of blade for the layout file which I had to do my own research on to be able to figure out how it works and how it is integrated in our pages. The other struggle was using a premade app.css which was overriding a lot of my work, so I had to work out naming conventions and more on what the CSS elements meant when using them.</p>
